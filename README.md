Generator -a backup (changeover process).
Mains- commonly used  (Solar acts as a cheaper alternative).
Maps-input co-ordinates to get location (automatic)
A visualisation of imported data from solar watt devices
Compare power output overtime
Achieve stability in power generation and transmission is the main objective in my data analysis
